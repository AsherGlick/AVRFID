I. Building and Burning the program
  There are commands in the source code that will help you compile and burn the
  program to the ATmega328
  
  
  To compile the program to a hex file
  `make hex`
  
  To burn the Hex file and the fusses on unix [Tested on ubuntu]
  `sudo avrdude -p m328p -c usbtiny -U flash:w:myproject.hex -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m -U efuse:w:0x07:m`
  
  To Burn Just the program on unix [Tested on ubuntu]
  `sudo avrdude -p m328p -c usbtiny -U flash:w:myproject.hex`
  
  On windows you can usually burn the program the same way
